# Scenario 1
Everyone has experienced difficulties during the pandemic, regardless of whether the consequences are large or small. This process, which affects all people and the country, has had an economic impact on countries. A citizen living in Mexico wanted to buy a car for himself after thinking for a long time. As a result of long-term research and interviews with friends and family, he made his decision and cleared his doubts about buying his car. However, these processes coincide with the moment when the virus emerged in China and started to spread to the world. Although most of the automotive production is done in Mexico, this citizen cannot buy the car he wants on the date he wants. This is because even though most auto parts are manufactured and assembled in Mexico, the rest of the parts are made in China and shipped to Mexico. With the closure of the borders during the pandemic process, the parts needed by the automotive industry could not go to Mexico and this citizen could not buy his car on the date he wanted.

# Scenario 2
Another citizen affected by this process is a woman living in the United States and making wedding preparations with her boyfriend. The couple, who wants all their wishes and thoughts to be in a perfect way, is making preparations. The woman ordered the wedding dress of her favorite model from a wedding dress shop and is waiting for the wedding dress to reach her hand. The wedding dress is produced in China and spread all over the world. Since the virus originated in China, China, which closed its borders and did not send products to any country, did not send this wedding dress either. The woman, whose wedding dress did not reach her almost a month after her order, witnessed how the virus affected even a modest citizen.

# So
As seen in these stories, with the emergence of the virus, not only the countries but also the ordinary citizens were affected by this situation, and as a result of the closure of the borders, the interactions that the countries could not make with each other affected everyone badly.
