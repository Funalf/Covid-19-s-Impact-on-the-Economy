#A)  
The epidemic has spread by turning everything upside down in the world and its effects have caused permanent problems and solutions. The biggest problem is the economic 
difficulties people experience. Many people have lost their jobs. As a result of these problems, many people have also had to be malnourished. At the same time, closing the borders
has caused commercial problems. Agricultural products could not be traded, so farmers had problems. Even if governments offer support packages, most farmers will not be able to 
benefit from these packages or will have problems in repaying them. I will discuss the pandemic's problem with the economy in this assignment. I will reach people badly affected
by the economy through interviews and news articles made to producers. Although clear information cannot be obtained, nearly clear it is can be addressed by looking at the general
of the problem.

#B) While doing this project, I need to examine how these effects have been in the world and Turkey. I will examine the news and articles written on this subject. I will make 
comparisons by looking at the past and the pandemic process. Mostly, I will reach the data by examining the researches made on the internet.
